This little mod adds a new activity called "One Man Army Extended". This activity is just like vanilla One Man Army except that it has a buy phase at the beginning so that you can buy and play as an Actor of your choice (AHuman only). Make sure to include weapons in the order, once you transfer control to your soldier there's no going back!

Yes, it supports multiple players.

Note: starting funds are dependent on difficulty at the moment.

Use the cccp-6 branch for compatibility with the [Cortex Command Community Project](https://cortex-command-community.github.io).
